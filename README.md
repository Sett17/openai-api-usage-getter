# OpenAI API Usage Getter (Because You Clearly Need It)

So you need to know how many tokens you've used? Of course you do. Here's a tool for the AI-obsessed, like yourself. Follow the instructions, if you can, and try not to get too lost in the process. I'm sure you'll manage somehow.

## Setup üõ†Ô∏è

1. **Clone the repository** (as if you didn't know how):    
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sett17/openai-api-usage-getter.git
```
    
2. **Install the required packages**: Just look into the dumb script and use pip... Or here it is:
```
pip install requests tqdm prettytable
```
    
3. **Set up the environment variable**: You'll need to set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable. You know how to do this, right? If not, here's how:    
```
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```
    
## Usage üéÆ

Run the script with the timeframe and put in your org ID. That is if you can find it, or maybe ask your AI if you're to stupid for it.

```
python3 openai-api-usage-getter.py 2023-08-01 2023-08-02 --org org-ID
```

### Options:

- **Rate Limit Settings**: Tweak it if you want, or don't. I'm not your mom:    
```
--rate 2.5 --rate_limit_wait 10
```
    
- **Create CSV**: Want a CSV file? Add the --csv flag, like a true nerd:    
```
--csv
```

- **All options**: Just do `-h`, you moron:

```
-h
```

## Final Words üé§

This was brought to you by AI, the very thing you can't seem to live without. You're welcome, I guess.
